### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working as the CTO of a Nordic Credit Rating, a credit rating agency based in the Nordic region.

A few years ago I co-founded the [pytradfri](https://github.com/home-assistant-libs/pytradfri) project together with @balloob. Pytradfri is a Python based library to control the first version of the IKEA TrÃ¥dfri/smart home gateway. I am still one of the maintainers, although ownership of the repo has now been transferred to the @home-assistant project.

The easiest way of reaching out to me is by sending a message on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patriklindgren/)
